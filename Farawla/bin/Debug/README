Hey, welcome to Farawla (beta)!

Farawla is a code editor that emphasizes minimalism and productivity. It is mainly intended 
for web developers and code hackers, while being easily extensible and customizable to cater 
for other platforms and aesthetics.

To take full advantage of what Farawla has to offer, keep reading.

== Sidebar
Just in case you didn't notice, there's a sidebar on your right. Move your mouse to the right
and it will slowly appear. Hopefully you won't have to use it much (you'll use the keyboard
shortcuts instead.)

== Projects & Quick Jump
To open a project, drag any folder and drop it here. The sidebar will show 
the name of the project on the top, and list its files in the tree view. Don't use your 
mouse to navigate files; that's lame. Instead, click CTRL+(comma), type part of the name, 
and hit enter.

	- CTRL+N				New tab

== Languages
In the directory of the EXE you'll find a 'languages' folder. Within that folder you'll find 
a folder for every language supported by Farawla. Each language folder has AT LEAST a
'main.js' file for meta-data and a 'syntax.js' file for regex-based definitions.
If you create a new language and you want see it part of the language package that comes 
with Farawla, please share! See documentation @ http://getfarawla.com for more info.

== Themes
To change the current theme, go to Settings on the sidebar, select a new theme, and 
restart Farawla.
In the directory of the EXE you'll find a 'themes' folder. Feel free to create a new
theme by cloning an existing one and modifying the values.
If you create a new theme and you want to see it part of the themes package that comes 
with Farawla, please share! See documentation @ http://getfarawla.com for more info.

Hey, welcome to Farawla (beta)!

Farawla is a code editor that emphasizes minimalism and productivity. It is mainly intended 
for web developers and code hackers, while being easily extensible and customizable to cater 
for other platforms and aesthetics.

To take full advantage of what Farawla has to offer, keep reading.

== Projects & Quick Jump
To open a project, drag any folder and drop it here. The sidebar will show the name of
the project on the top, and list its files in the tree view. Don't use your mouse to navigate
files... that's lame. Instead, click CTRL+(comma), type part of the name, and hit enter. 

== Keyboard Shortcuts

	- CTRL+N				New tab
	- CTRL+F4				Close tab
	- CTRL+SHIFT+T		Open last closed tab

	- Home					Beginning of line

== Languages
In the directory of the EXE you'll find a 'languages' folder. Within that folder you'll find 
a folder for every language supported by Farawla. Each language folder has AT LEAST a
'main.js' file for meta-data and a 'syntax.js' file for regex-based definitions.
If you create a new language and you want see it part of the language package that comes

# Farawla
Farawla ([link](http://getfarawla.com)) is a code editor for Windows. The goal of this project (which started around 2010) was to create a less boring code editor for dynamic languages, with small experiments in design and productivity. 

Farawla follows a [Feature-Centric Design Pattern](http://anaimi.com/16). It is the original project that inspired this design pattern.

A binary version of the editor is available here: http://getfarawla.com

This project is no longer maintained.

## Only code
Zero clutter. By default, all what you see is your code. Move your mouse to the right and a sidebar will slowly appear -- you will rarely use the sidebar.

## Quick jump
Instead of expanding folders and double clicking files to open a document, use Quick Jump. Hit CTRL+(comma) and write part of the file's name. Hit enter. You're there. This is hands down the fastest way to open a file.

## Keyboard shortcuts
In addition to the context menu, Farawla provides a familiar set of keyboard shortcuts similar to the behavior of popular browsers.

## Completion
Disabled for most languages by default. Completion allows you to enable and disable platform and language helpers, allowing for simple type inference and intellisense-like behavior. Farawla provides a ridiculously simple approach to define completions for any platform.

## Snippits
Standard snippit support is available.
